# Splash

> Tooling to help develop application on the Flow Blockchain

This repo is a fork of [Go with the Flow](https://github.com/bjartek/go-with-the-flow) (GWFT), a Go library that
had been deprecated in favour of [Overflow](https://github.com/bjartek/overflow). We used  GWFT in
[Sequel Contracts](https://github.com/piprate/sequel-flow-contracts) repo. When GWTF was replaced by Overflow,
we decided to keep it because Overflow seemed to have followed slightly different design ideas while GWFT
offered exactly what we needed.

We subsequently upgraded GWTF to Cadence 1.0.

## Credits

 - [GWFT](https://github.com/bjartek/go-with-the-flow) was a rewrite of https://github.com/versus-flow/go-flow-tooling.
 - Splash is an evolution of GWTF.
